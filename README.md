# Blackjack but in Multiple Languages
The simple game of terminal based blackjack in multiple programming languages.

When I try to learn a programming language, I find it really hard to do unless I have a project to work towards.
Recently I've decided to learn C and C++, but I need a project to truly understand the programming languages and the mess of pointers.
I decided that project is terminal based blackjack, which isn't hard to have because the game logic is pretty simple, but I decided to make it look prettier
in the end so that it's useable.
In this repo you can expect to see all my attempts at creating Blackjack in languages I plan learn. What languages are those you may ask? Well I'm glad you asked!

## Planned Languages

| Language  | Status | ASCII Cards | Input Handling\*|
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| C  | Completed | Yes | Yes |
| C++  | In Development | N/A | N/A |
| Java  | Not Started | N/A | N/A |
| Python  | Not Started | N/A | N/A |

\*Making sure that user input will not error out the code to the best of my ability
